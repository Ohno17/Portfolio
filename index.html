					<h2 id="intro">Hello, my name is <span id="name">Ajay</span>.</h2>

					<p>
						I first started to code when I was 9 years old because I wanted to make games for my friends to
						play. I started on Scratch, learning the basics of programming. After making a couple games with
						Scratch, I realized that I wanted to be a programmer. When I had grown tired of Scratch&apos;s
						limitations, I started making games on Roblox, where I utilized a programming language named
						Lua. Now that I had learned Lua, a text-based language, I started to branch out into other
						languages like Python, Java, C, and HTML/CSS. I took classes at Code Ninja for a year and
						learned Javascript. From there I continued to code and make new projects in different
						programming languages. With my skills in programming, I taught the people around me how to
						code.<br><br>

						In our middle school&apos;s VEX Robotics club, I was the lead programmer in our team, who had gotten
						4th place. I had learned to take into account the design of the robot as well as the driver&apos;s
						feedback in order to create an effective program.<br><br>

						When I was participating in a First Robotics team, teamwork was an important part of building
						our robot. We worked together, and discussed solutions, developing important engineering skills
						in the process. I had learned how to gather and evaluate information to make decisions, and
						because of that, I felt that my experience on the team was very rewarding and educational.
